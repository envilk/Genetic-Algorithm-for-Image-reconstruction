# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Image-reconstruction

This project is property of the Evolutionary Algorithms subject, Master in Artificial 
Inteligence and Software Engineering at University of MÃ¡laga. The article describing the code and the 
experiments are written in spanish. The concluded idea is that this algorithm is not the good one to apply to
image reconstruction of images from "img1.txt" to "img4.txt".
